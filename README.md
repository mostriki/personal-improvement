# _Whiteboard Wednesday_

#### _An independent project to expose areas for improvement within my development and overcome them with deliberate practice, 11.03.2017_

#### By _Riki Montgomery_

### Description

_Today I set out to develop curriculum for a weekly meetup and whiteboarding session. The goal is to help my classmates improve their chances at finding jobs after code school. I also want to improve some of my own deficiencies, like writing logic, speaking confidently about my code, increasing my typing speed, and memorizing common industry terms and jargon. I started out by researching and collecting important terms and concepts that we had covered in class. I took extra care to type out their names and definitions manually in order to increase my own comprehension and typing proficiency. I also spent the morning reading articles and blog posts on the subject of interviews and technical questions. Unfortunatly I was not able to complete the curriculum by 5 p.m., so I will be spending my weekend on it. Our first Whiteboard Wednesday will be on November 8th._
